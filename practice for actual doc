The humble Malus domestica, with its thousands of varieties, ranges from the tooth-achingly sweet Fuji to the sharp, almost effervescent Granny Smith. While most people picture the classic red apple sitting on a teacher's desk, wild apples originally came from Kazakhstan, where ancient forests still harbor the ancestors of our modern fruits. Today's supermarket apples are technological marvels, engineered through centuries of careful cultivation to stay fresh for months in controlled atmosphere storage, though they've lost some of the complex flavors that made their wild cousins so interesting to our ancestors.</p>
